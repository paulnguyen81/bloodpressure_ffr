# Predicting heart treatment from intravascular ultrasound data

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Plaque build-up in coronary arteries surrounding the heart can block blood flow damaging the heart muscle. Intravascular ultrasound imaging is used to monitor stenosis, the narrowing of coronary arteries, and evaluate treatment for heart disease. In this project I predict whether patients are candidates for heart treatment by measuring blood flow pressure drop, known as fractional flow reserve (FFR). From geometric features extracted from intravascular ultrasound images, 128 new feautres are extracted to assist with training a supervised classification model. The project is part of professor Geena Kimâ€™s research on heart disease and intravascular ultrasound data.
